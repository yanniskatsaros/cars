# Who Scraped My Car?
WebScraping Cars.com with Python and BeautifulSoup4
_____

The purpose of this project is to practice implementing a complete Data Science workflow. This includes:
* Webscraping with BeautifulSoup4 and Requests
* Interacting with SQLite3 to store/query the data
* Pre-processing/manipulating the data into a model-friendly format with Pandas
* Building a model to price the cars and rank them by the best deals available with Scikit-Learn
* Visualizing the data and model results with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
* Deploying an interactive dashboard with Dash and Flask

This is a work in progress.
Hope you enjoy!
